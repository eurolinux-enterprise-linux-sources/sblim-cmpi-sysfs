Test Environment for SBLIM Network Instrumentation

The SBLIM project offers a Test Suite to perform tests against
the provider implementation and consistence tests against system
values.

Prerequisites 
.............

- sblim-testsuite package propertly installed
- sblim-cmpi-base package propertly installed
- sblim-cmpi-nfsv4 package propertly installed


Install Configuration Files
...........................

make install
... also installs the configuration file into the testsuite directory
as indicated by configure

make uninstall
... also deletes the cmpi-nfsv4 specific files out of the testsuite
directories


Run Test
........

Run the test in the testsuite dir by executing 
./sblim-cmpi-nfsv4-test.sh
                                                                                
In order for the createInstance() and deleteInstance() tests to
run correctly, you must replace the value of HOSTNAME in the
following file(s) with the fully-qualified hostname of your test
machine and uncomment the corresponding line. Edit the file(s):
        ./cim/Linux_NFSv4SystemSetting.cim

TEST WARNINGS
-------------
Some of the instance tests will report an warning. This is 'normal'
and is a result of the fact that some of the sysfs parameters, and
therefore their associated /sys files, change constantly.
In particular, random seeds, entropy, and inode values change
all the time so the original value read into in CIM may not be
identical to the current value read by the test scripts.


TEST ERRORS
-----------
It is not in general possible to determine the specific high-level sysfs
device directory to which a particular sysfs attribute file might below
(whereas the converse *is* true - the sysfs attributes associated with a
particular device are all the subfile of the device directory). As a result
the association between, say, Linux_SysfsBlockDevices and Linux_SysfsAttributes
is one-way only. That is to say, given a specific Linux_SysfsBlockDevice the
association provider will return all the associated Linux_SysfsAttributes, however
given a specific Linux_SysfsAttribute it cannot determine the associated
Linux_SysfsBlockDevice.

Because of the one-way assocation, most of the association tests run by the
testsuite as it stands today will FAIL, because the testsuite assumes two-way
assocaitions. There are also some other incompatibilites (and bugs) when
running the testsuite association test with the sysfs instrumentation, therefore
it was decided to remove ALL the association tests from this test suite at
this time. All the relevant test scripts are included, but they will not be
run by default when you execute sblim-cmpi-sysfs-test.sh
